Instructions

In this repo, I have included my c# source classes, executable demo program and the arduino sketch this was built around

if you want to play with it right away,
I expect you alreay know how to load arduino sketch files to your arduino boards

1) Load the sketch in the arduino IDE and flash it to your arduino device. (tested on mega, uno, and due **(does not work on the due properly)**)
2) Your arduino must be connected to your pc
3) Since you flashed your device already you should remember the COM port the arduino is connected on for the program

4) Launch the executable
5) Type the number next to the com port that your arduino is listening on
6) Type the number next to the baud rate of 9600 for this demo
7) You will see a list of commands to demo.

These commands are defined in the firmware and invoked in the program. You will see in my source files how this all works

enjoy!! - VN
